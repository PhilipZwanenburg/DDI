# Coding Goals

\todo Follow scikit-learn for python related project functionality (build testing/documentation): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn

# Implementation Goals

## Easy

Add documentation using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and automatically link to
github project using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

For several data sets of low-growth ETFs, develop a graphical output for ideal trading behaviour given perfect
information (i.e. buy low, sell high).
- This would potentially take the form of a set of plots with time along the x-axis:
	- ETF information: market value, trading volume, etc (All information available in csv file);
	- Current algorithm behaviour: buy, sell, hold;
- This can be visualized using matplotlib.
