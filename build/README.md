### Building the Documentation

Documention can be generated by executing the following command:
```sh
ROOT/build$ doxygen ../doc/doxyfile.cfg
```

The generated documentation can then be viewed by pointing a browser at the corresponding `index.html' file:
```sh
ROOT/build/html$ firefox index.html
```
